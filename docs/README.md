# AW_MediaQS

Browser extension for quick saving, opening and copying media files with customizable hotkeys without context menu. Just move mouse cursor on media and push hotkey!
Compatibly with chrome and operaGX.
Custom folders work on Windows. Mac and Linux not tested.
The extension was made according to my need, but it may be useful to someone with the same needs.

p.s. i just wan't to pay 5$ to google for deploy this in store for free
